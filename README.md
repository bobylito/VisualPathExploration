VisualPathExploration tool
==========================

This is a tool to visualize sentences for the task of Relation Extraction. 
It is compatible with a modified BioNLP'13 ("Genia") format of input files and it produces two types of visualizations:

1. Sentences and their parsings (Named Entities, dependencies, POS tags, etc)
2. The alignment between two sentences
